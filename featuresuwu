(Build A Boat For Treasure); id == 537413528;

// autofarm;
   > speed adjustable (how many seconds before reaching the end); (lesser the time, the less coins you get); (def. value is 20 seconds);
   > autofarm methods to choose from;
     ~ { tween or teleport }; (both approx. require the same amount of time);

// boat fly;
   > speed adjustable;
   > methods;
    ~ { tpfly (really buggy); , normal bodygyro + bodyvelocity + bodyforce fly };

// copy other peoples boat; (not recommended to be used);
  > super buggy;
  > will crash u if it tries to copy > 50 ~ 100 blocks;
  > works for 15 blocks lol;
    ~ most of this is due to it just gets the positions of the blocks and stores them in a table which becomes really laggy since there are so many large values;
      being stored at once (most likely will crash lol);
    ~ i could store it on a server but thats if this hub is ever paid; (probably never since idk how to code lua well and its probably gonna be really shitty);

// discord webhook support;
  > u can enable it for the script to send how much $$$ u have earnt every run;
    ~ will send the total (final) amt you have earnt when you leave/disconnect/idle/whatever from the server; (playerremoving event basically);

(Sandhurst Military Academy by ReaperAaron); id == 3295514368;

// crystal ac bypass;
    > basically anything u can name that crystal ac can detect is blocked; :D
    > would like to mention fly is fixed btw;

// get any gun; (does not require anyone with the gun itself to be in the game);
    > p90, golden glock, scar-h, l85, l86a2, akm, glock, mk48; (basically any gun in the game lol, dont know if i named all);

// get motorbike;
    > basically gets motorbike; {safely};

// clickkill;
    > 5 second cooldown (bypasses teamcheck); (bypasses leaderboard ko count);
      ~ note: do not spam click with this as it might still cause the clickkill to run 2 times in a row 
         ~ the script already has measures for the 5 second cooldown but it is still possible to slip in another click

// clickkill; (no cooldown, does not bypass teamcheck, does not bypass leaderboard ko count);

// kill all; (does not bypass teamcheck sadly);
    > takes about 2 seconds for all damage-abled to die :D;

// ddos everyone but yourself; (this is such a lame method but whatever);

// crash server; (server will freeze for about 5 mins or so before disconnecting everyone);
   > or else it freezes the server indefinetely

// silent aim; (bullet velocity/travel will not matter, it will ALWAYS hit the target that is closest to your mouse/in your fov);
    ~ team check ofc;
    ~ fov circle showing; fov circle size; (default value is 60);
    ~ esp; (toggled on or off);
// auto get attire;
    ~ physical;
    ~ standard;
    ~ formals;
    ~ any hair, chosen by a dropdown gui;
// hide username + rank + regiment;

// fake afk; (move while being afk); (button press func, cannot be reversed due to the nature of namecall hooks); (rejoin to disable);

// rainbow attire; (not really rainbow); (funny feature);
  ~ loop equips and unequips all hairs and attires so it looks epic lol;

  > auto clean poop;
  > auto click floppa;
  > infinite sanity;
  > auto buy; (works for backrooms but you need to be in the backrooms itself as there is a check, sad ikr :c) 
  > go to the backrooms shop without it being open;
  > go to the ufo shop
  > max altar instantly; (u ofc need the amount of cash to max it, approx. amt == $33m something dollars i cant be bothered to do the math to get the exact value);
  > grab all meteorites instantly;
  > murder all bandits; 
  > murder king bingus;
  > use all almond water on floppa instantly;
  > auto play and finish the whole game (gets time cube, buys stuff, WIP);

(Jailbreak); id == 606849621; (autofarm complete rewrite attempt lol); (you should definetely use other hubs' jailbreak over this one lol);
 > autofarm;
   ~ for now only supports:
      ~ bank, jewelry store, donut store, gas station;
         ~ working to expand it but creating a autofarm for jailbreak just takes sooo long
 > gun mods; (untested, its my old gun mod lol);
 > infinite nitro; (untested as well);
 > walkspeed, jumppower, fly, vehiclefly; (speed adjustable);
   ~ auto hash grabber too btw

(Auto-training/tryouts/whatever you wanna call it); (universal);
  > supported types of jacks:
      ~ jumping jacks;
      ~ hell jacks;
      ~ grammar jacks;
      ~ cheer jacks;
  > auto drills;
    ~ left (turn); (incline);
    ~ right (turn); (incline);
    ~ about (turn);
    ~ control (turn); (spin speed when host is on you can be adjusted);
    ~ centre (turn);
    ~ auto error detection;
  > auto obby; (VERY buggy);
    ~ preset obbies made already for reaperaaron's ba; (NOT all); (pathfinding bugs out at random times so hah ah ah ha haaaaaaaa);
  > ai training;
    ~ will do jacks and drills for you automatically, referencing what the host says; all you have to do is cite the host name to the script through a gui;
    ~ auto the WHOLE TRAINING; (jjs, drills, obbies, wedge, saying thank you to the host lol); (soon.. cuz pathfinding being hella gay);
  > fully customisable;
    ~ admin command to change;
      :override [old command] [new command];
      ~ example:
        :override squad_left_turn squad_left_face;
        --// result: will now turn 90 degrees to the left when
        SQUAD,
        LEFT,
        FACE!
        is said/detected;
        --\\
      ~ another example:
        :override squad_right_incline squad_left_incline;
        --// will now turn 45 degrees to the right when
        SQUAD,
        LEFT,
        INCLINE!
        is said/detected;
        --\\
     ~ all spaces in the new command must be denoted with a underscore --> ("_");
     ~ ik this is all hard to understand but basically: it overrides what the old command with the new command but keeps the function of the old command;
       assigned to the new command when it is called;
     ~ simplified for idiots (no offence): just does whatever the old command does when the new command is said
 > save settings;
  ~ allow saving of your current settings, will save your customisations;

(Universal Aimbot and ESP);
   > uses mousemoveabs or mousemoverel to make your mouse lock onto the player; (undetected); (works for camera aimbot too);
      ~bypasses futuretops's antircm check (normally aimbot wouldnt work but now it can :D)
   > fov, fov circle (enable, size);
   > esp; (enabled/disabled);
    ~ colour3.new (colour basically) can be chosen;
    ~ tracers;
    ~ colour can be according to team colour (toggable);
   > legit mode;
    ~ makes your mouse move to random parts (can be chosen); on targeted player in a attempt to look legit;
